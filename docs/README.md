Victoria is a lightweight, offline task-tracking chatbot you run from the terminal or inside IntelliJ.
It lets you add to-dos, deadlines, and events, then mark, unmark, search, and delete them—all with simple commands. 
Your tasks autosave to a file so they’re there the next time you launch.

// Give examples of usage

Example: `keyword (optional arguments)`
