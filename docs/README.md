**Victoria** is a lightweight, offline task-tracking CLI chatbot youcan run from the terminal or inside IntelliJ.
It lets you add todos, deadlines, and events, then mark, unmark, search, and delete them—all with simple commands. 
Your tasks autosave to a file so they’re there the next time you launch.
