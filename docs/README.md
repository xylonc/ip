**Victoria** is a lightweight, offline task-tracking CLI chatbot youcan run from the terminal or inside IntelliJ.
It lets you add todos, deadlines, and events, then mark, unmark, search, and delete them—all with simple commands. 
Your tasks autosave to a file so they’re there the next time you launch.

## Adding to-dos
Adds a task into the task list.

Example:`todo 

## Adding deadlines

Adds a task with a deadline into the task list.

Format: `deadline [description of task] /by [deadline]`

Example: `deadline sleep /by sunday`

Output will give :
-1. confirmation message that task with deadline added
-2. display the description of task
-3. number of tasks currently in the list 

```
okies brother. I added this deadline!
[D][ ] sleep (by: sunday)
now you got: 1 tasks
```
